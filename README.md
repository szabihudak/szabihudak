# Quality Engineering Showcase

> A Senior SDET / Quality Engineering case study demonstrating how I design maintainable, reproducible, and scalable quality engineering systems.

This showcase presents the architecture, implementation patterns, execution model, engineering decisions, and evolution of a **Playwright + TypeScript Quality Engineering framework**.

The focus goes beyond writing automated tests. It demonstrates how different quality concerns can be designed as a coherent engineering system with clear ownership, deterministic setup, runtime validation, reproducible execution, CI/CD integration, actionable quality signals, failure diagnostics, and governed AI assistance.

## What This Project Demonstrates

The underlying framework is developed as an **automation engineering system rather than a collection of test scripts**.

Current implementation demonstrates:

- API and browser automation with Playwright;
- schema-first API contracts with TypeBox and AJV runtime validation;
- typed PostgreSQL persistence validation with explicit application and database boundaries;
- Page Object and Component Object architecture;
- reusable fixtures and deterministic test-data factories;
- programmatic API and browser authentication;
- API-driven test setup and network mocking;
- Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit execution;
- automated accessibility testing with axe-core;
- deterministic visual regression testing;
- API performance testing with k6;
- browser performance testing with Lighthouse;
- framework-owned AI Failure Analysis;
- framework-owned AI Test Suite Generation;
- structured OpenAI output validation and evidence sanitization;
- repository-aware GitHub Copilot and Copilot Agent workflows;
- OpenAPI MCP-assisted contract discovery;
- Playwright MCP-assisted browser exploration;
- Golden Template-based AI engineering guidance;
- deterministic validation and human review of AI-assisted engineering changes;
- reproducible Docker execution;
- responsibility-based GitHub Actions CI/CD;
- GHCR image reuse across CI jobs;
- reports and failure diagnostics;
- documented engineering standards and architectural decisions.

The engineering roadmap extends the portfolio into AI-native testing platform evaluation, QE strategy and leadership, system design, security, and observability.

## Architecture at a Glance

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    QE[Production-style Quality Engineering Framework]

    QE --> TQE[Traditional QE]
    QE --> AIQE[AI-Assisted QE]
    QE --> AIE[AI-Assisted Engineering]

    TQE --> TQEF["API & Contracts<br/>Database Validation<br/>UI & Cross-Browser<br/>Accessibility<br/>Visual Regression<br/>Performance"]

    AIQE --> AIQEF["AI Failure Analysis<br/>AI Test Suite Generation<br/>OpenAI Integration<br/>Structured Output Validation<br/>Human Review"]

    AIE --> AIEF["GitHub Copilot<br/>Copilot Agent<br/>OpenAPI MCP<br/>Playwright MCP<br/>Golden Templates"]

    TQEF --> FOUNDATION[Deterministic Validation + Human Engineering Review]
    AIQEF --> FOUNDATION
    AIEF --> FOUNDATION
```

The architecture treats traditional Quality Engineering, framework-owned AI capabilities, and AI-assisted engineering as distinct responsibilities operating within the same engineering system.

AI does not replace deterministic validation or engineering ownership. It operates inside those boundaries.

Execution still follows the responsibility being tested:

```text
API
→ browser independent
→ execute once

Database
→ persistence responsibility
→ dedicated browser-independent database project

UI
→ browser-dependent behavior
→ Chromium / Firefox / WebKit

Accessibility
→ dedicated quality responsibility
→ Chromium

Visual Regression
→ deterministic rendering
→ canonical Docker/Linux environment

API Performance
→ k6

Browser Performance
→ Lighthouse
```

## Execution Evidence

The public showcase includes **reviewed evidence from real executions of the canonical framework**.

Published execution evidence currently covers:

- API and runtime contract validation;
- Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit UI execution;
- automated accessibility analysis;
- deterministic visual regression;
- k6 API performance;
- public Lighthouse CI execution;
- authenticated Playwright + Lighthouse execution;
- reports, screenshots, visual baselines, and failure diagnostics.

Database validation and AI capabilities are implemented and validated, while their public representation intentionally distinguishes implementation and validation evidence from dedicated public execution artifacts.

### API & Contract

**28 / 28 tests passed**

The published API evidence demonstrates authentication, runtime contract validation, validation behavior, negative paths, and deterministic test data.

[Inspect API execution evidence →](docs/showcases/api/README.md)

### Database Validation

Database validation uses typed PostgreSQL clients to verify persisted application state while keeping application behavior and direct database verification as separate responsibilities.

The implementation includes:

- domain-specific typed database clients;
- a dedicated browser-independent database project;
- application-boundary state creation;
- persistence verification;
- retries disabled for persistent-state scenarios;
- a guarded explicit reset lifecycle.

Dedicated sanitized public database execution artifacts are not currently published. The capability is represented through its validated implementation, architecture, and lifecycle model rather than a fabricated execution report.

[Explore database validation →](docs/capabilities/database/)

### UI & Cross-Browser

**18 / 18 tests passed**

The same browser scenarios execute across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, with six passing tests per browser engine.

[Inspect UI execution evidence →](docs/showcases/ui/README.md)

### Accessibility

The accessibility quality gate detected **two real product accessibility issues** rather than converting the run into an artificial green result.

The selected evidence includes serious `color-contrast` violations with an observed contrast ratio of **3.81:1** against the required **4.5:1**.

[Inspect accessibility evidence →](docs/showcases/accessibility/README.md)

### Visual Regression

**2 / 2 visual tests passed** against approved Linux baselines.

The published evidence demonstrates deterministic application state, controlled rendering, full-page and component-level screenshot comparison, and explicit baseline ownership.

[Inspect visual regression evidence →](docs/showcases/visual-regression/README.md)

### Performance

Performance responsibility is separated into API workload and browser-observed measurement.

Published evidence includes:

```text
k6 API workload
→ 2 VUs / 30 seconds
→ 52 iterations
→ 56 / 56 checks
→ 0% failures
→ p95 257.33 ms

Public Lighthouse CI
→ 3 runs
→ canonical LHCI assertions
→ execution completed without assertion failure

Authenticated Lighthouse
→ Playwright-established authenticated state
→ 3 independent audits
→ median aggregation for portfolio reporting
```

Standalone Lighthouse CI assertions and portfolio median summaries are intentionally treated as different concepts. The median summaries do not represent Lighthouse CI's assertion algorithm.

[Inspect performance evidence →](docs/showcases/performance/README.md)

### Failure Diagnostics

A selected accessibility failure is preserved as a diagnostic case study.

The evidence demonstrates that a failed quality gate is not automatically a framework regression. Reports and artifacts are used to distinguish product defects from framework, environment, infrastructure, external-platform, and known-product-issue domains.

[Inspect diagnostic evidence →](docs/showcases/diagnostics/README.md)

> Docker, GitHub Actions, and GHCR are implemented parts of the canonical engineering system. Their architecture is documented publicly; a dedicated sanitized public CI/CD / Docker / GHCR execution-evidence package is intentionally deferred.

## AI-Assisted Quality Engineering

Framework-owned AI capabilities operate on explicit inputs and produce structured outputs that remain subject to human engineering review.

### AI Failure Analysis

```text
Playwright Failure
      ↓
Execution Evidence
      ↓
Evidence Sanitization
      ↓
OpenAI Analysis
      ↓
Structured Diagnostic Output
      ↓
Human Review
      ↓
Engineering Decision
```

Failure analysis is advisory. It does not own the quality-gate result or replace deterministic failure evidence.

### AI Test Suite Generation

```text
System / Feature Context
      ↓
Risk & Behavior Inputs
      ↓
OpenAI
      ↓
Structured Test Suite Proposal
      ↓
Human Review
      ↓
Approved Coverage Model
      ↓
Implementation
```

Generated coverage is treated as a proposal rather than automatically accepted test design.

[Explore AI-Assisted Quality Engineering →](docs/capabilities/ai-assisted-qe/)

## AI-Assisted Engineering

AI-assisted engineering is governed by repository architecture, authoritative external evidence, human review, and deterministic validation.

```text
Repository Architecture
        +
Golden Templates
        +
Authoritative External Evidence
        ↓
AI Engineering Context
        ↓
GitHub Copilot / Agent
        ↓

        ↓
Targeted Feedback
        ↓
Refined Implementation
        ↓
Typecheck / Tests / CI
        ↓

```

MCP integrations provide authoritative discovery inputs rather than replacing repository knowledge:

```text
                 Application
                     │
          ┌──────────┴──────────┐
          ↓                     ↓
     OpenAPI MCP          Playwright MCP
          ↓                     ↓
     API Contract          UI Behavior
     Discovery             Discovery
          └──────────┬──────────┘
                     ↓
             Repository Context
                     ↓
            Copilot / Agent
                     ↓
           Test Implementation
                     ↓
              Human Review
                     ↓
          Deterministic Validation
```

The governing principle is that **architecture drives AI-assisted implementation, not the other way around**.

## Selected Engineering Highlights

### Schema-First Runtime Contracts

Compile-time TypeScript types do not prove that an external provider actually returned the expected structure.

The API layer therefore validates successful provider responses at runtime before test code trusts the returned data.

```text
HTTP Response
      ↓
Status Assertion
      ↓
Parse Response
      ↓
AJV Runtime Validation
      ↓
Typed Business Assertions
```

TypeBox provides the schema/type relationship while AJV validates the actual runtime response.

---

### Database Persistence Boundaries

Database validation verifies persisted application state without moving application setup or business behavior into the database layer.

```text
Spec
  ↓
Fixture
  ↓
Domain Database Client
  ↓
DatabaseClient
  ↓
PostgreSQL
```

Application state is created through supported application boundaries. Direct database access is used to verify persistence and lifecycle behavior rather than bypass the application under test.

---

### Deterministic Test Architecture

Test setup favors reusable fixtures, deterministic factories, and API-driven initialization when browser interaction is not the behavior under test.

```text
Scenario
   ↓
Fixture
   ↓
Factory
   ↓
API / Authentication Setup
   ↓
Deterministic Application State
   ↓
Behavior Under Test
```

The objective is to keep tests focused on the behavior they own while reusable infrastructure manages setup and lifecycle concerns.

---

### Explicit Execution Ownership

Execution scope follows the responsibility being tested.

Browser-independent API and database coverage are not multiplied across browser engines. UI behavior owns cross-browser execution. Accessibility and visual regression have dedicated execution boundaries.

Performance testing uses the runtime appropriate to the measurement responsibility:

```text
API workload performance
→ k6

Browser-observed performance
→ Lighthouse
```

This avoids unnecessary execution while keeping quality ownership explicit.

---

### Reproducible Visual Testing

Visual regression uses:

- deterministic application state;
- native Playwright screenshot assertions;
- version-controlled approved baselines;
- explicit baseline review;
- a canonical Docker/Linux rendering environment.

CI compares against approved baselines. It does not automatically approve rendering changes.

---

### Reuse Before New Abstraction

When deterministic setup already exists in the functional framework, additional quality coverage reuses that setup instead of creating parallel business-state initialization.

The authenticated Lighthouse path follows this principle:

```text
existing deterministic setup
        ↓
authenticated application state
        ↓
representative page state
        ↓
Lighthouse measurement
```

The measurement layer changes. The business-state initialization does not.

---

### Build Once, Run Many

The main Playwright CI pipeline builds one reusable Docker image and publishes it to GHCR under the current commit SHA.

Downstream execution responsibilities reuse that exact image.

```text
quality
   ↓
build image once
   ↓
GHCR : commit SHA
   ↓
   ├── API
   ├── Accessibility
   ├── Visual Regression
   └── UI Browser Matrix
```

This separates the reusable execution environment from the Playwright project responsible for deciding what executes.

[Explore the engineering decisions →](docs/ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md)

---

## CI/CD at a Glance

The main CI dependency model is:

```text
quality
├── formatting
└── typecheck
        ↓
build-image
        ↓
push immutable commit-SHA image to GHCR
        ↓
        ├── API
        ├── Accessibility
        ├── Visual Regression
        └── UI Browser Matrix
              ├── Chromium
              ├── Firefox
              └── WebKit
```

The downstream Playwright responsibilities reuse the same container image rather than rebuilding separate environments for individual test projects.

Performance execution is owned separately:

```text
Performance Workflow
├── k6 API Performance
└── Browser Performance
    ├── Standalone Lighthouse
    └── Authenticated Playwright + Lighthouse
```

The current hosted performance workflow is intentionally separate from normal push and pull-request execution because the target application is shared infrastructure rather than an isolated load-test environment.

The CI/CD, Docker, and GHCR implementation is documented publicly. Dedicated sanitized public execution evidence for this infrastructure layer is intentionally deferred.

## Selected Source

This repository is intentionally **not a public mirror of the complete framework**.

The core API and UI automation architecture is published here as **selected public-safe source copied directly from the verified canonical implementation**, without showcase-specific rewrites.

The published source includes:

```text
config/
└── environments/

src/
├── accessibility/   # shared canonical dependencies used by the published fixture layer
├── api/
├── components/
├── data/
├── fixtures/
├── mocks/
├── pages/
└── utils/

tests/
├── api/
├── smoke/
└── ui/
```

This source demonstrates:

- domain API client design;
- TypeBox contracts and AJV runtime validation;
- Page Object and Component Object boundaries;
- fixture composition and programmatic authentication;
- deterministic test-data factories;
- network mocking;
- API, smoke, and cross-browser UI test design;
- environment-aware configuration.

Public representation intentionally differs by capability:

```text
API / UI / Cross-Browser
→ selected public-safe canonical source
→ architecture
→ real sanitized execution evidence

Database
→ validated canonical implementation
→ architecture and lifecycle model
→ dedicated sanitized public execution evidence deferred

Accessibility / Visual Regression / Performance
→ architecture
→ real sanitized execution evidence

AI-Assisted QE
→ validated canonical implementation
→ structured AI workflows
→ human review boundary

AI-Assisted Engineering
→ repository-aware workflow
→ authoritative MCP discovery
→ human review
→ deterministic validation

Docker / GitHub Actions / GHCR
→ implemented canonical architecture
→ public architecture documentation
→ dedicated sanitized execution-evidence publication deferred
```

Source publication remains deliberately selective.

The goal is to make the **core API and UI architecture fully inspectable** while demonstrating broader Quality Engineering capability without publishing the complete canonical framework or creating a parallel framework that must be maintained independently.

---

## Runnable Public Framework

Alongside this curated showcase, a standalone public Playwright + TypeScript framework is available for direct inspection, cloning, and local execution.

It demonstrates the core API, UI, contract-validation, cross-browser, Docker, and CI engineering patterns represented throughout this portfolio.

**[Explore the runnable Playwright Enterprise Framework →](https://github.com/szabihudak/playwright-enterprise-framework)**

The runnable repository is intentionally separate from the complete canonical framework and from this curated evidence layer.

## About This Showcase

This repository is a **curated public Quality Engineering case study**.

The complete implementation is maintained separately as the canonical engineering source of truth.

The public showcase combines:

```text
Selected Implementation
        +
Architecture
        +
Engineering Decisions
        +
Real Execution Evidence
        +
AI-Assisted Quality Engineering
        +
AI-Assisted Engineering
        +
Portfolio Presentation
        +
Engineering Roadmap
```

Every implemented capability presented here must be backed by verified implementation.

Every execution result presented here must come from real framework execution and pass a public-safety review.

AI-assisted outputs remain subject to deterministic validation and human engineering review.

Future capabilities remain explicitly identified as roadmap work until they are implemented and validated.

The objective is not to expose the largest possible amount of source code.

It is to make the **engineering system, implementation quality, design decisions, evidence, and evolution of the Quality Engineering approach** easy to evaluate.
