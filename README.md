# Quality Engineering Showcase

> A Senior SDET / Quality Engineering case study demonstrating how I design maintainable, reproducible, and scalable quality engineering systems.

This showcase presents the architecture, implementation patterns, execution model, engineering decisions, and evolution of a **Playwright + TypeScript Quality Engineering framework**.

The focus goes beyond writing automated tests. It demonstrates how different quality concerns can be designed as a coherent engineering system with clear ownership, deterministic setup, runtime validation, reproducible execution, CI/CD integration, actionable quality signals, failure diagnostics, and governed AI assistance.

## What This Project Demonstrates

The underlying framework is developed as an **automation engineering system rather than a collection of test scripts**.

Current implementation demonstrates:

- API and browser automation with Playwright;
- schema-first API contracts with TypeBox and AJV runtime validation;
- Page Object and Component Object architecture;
- reusable fixtures and deterministic test-data factories;
- programmatic API and browser authentication;
- API-driven test setup and network mocking;
- Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit execution;
- automated accessibility testing with axe-core;
- deterministic visual regression testing;
- API performance testing with k6;
- browser performance testing with Lighthouse;
- reproducible Docker execution;
- responsibility-based GitHub Actions CI/CD;
- GHCR image reuse across CI jobs;
- reports and failure diagnostics;
- AI Failure Analysis with sanitized execution evidence and structured output validation;
- AI Test Suite Generation with structured test-design output and explicit missing-context handling;
- repository-aware GitHub Copilot and Copilot Agent engineering workflows;
- Golden Template-guided AI implementation;
- OpenAPI MCP-assisted contract discovery;
- Playwright MCP-assisted browser exploration;
- human review and deterministic validation of AI-assisted engineering changes;
- documented engineering standards and architectural decisions.

The engineering roadmap now extends the portfolio into AI-native testing platform evaluation, QE strategy and leadership, system design, security, and observability.

```

The architecture separates **test behavior from reusable infrastructure** and assigns execution according to testing responsibility.

AI capabilities follow the same ownership principle. AI Failure Analysis and AI Test Suite Generation operate through structured framework boundaries, while AI-assisted engineering combines repository context, Golden Templates, external discovery evidence, human review, and deterministic validation.

This means the framework does not simply execute every test through every available runtime or treat AI output as engineering authority.

For example:

```text
API
→ browser independent
→ execute once

UI
→ browser-dependent behavior
→ Chromium / Firefox / WebKit

Accessibility
→ dedicated quality responsibility
→ Chromium

Visual Regression
→ deterministic rendering
→ canonical Docker/Linux environment

API Performance
→ k6

Browser Performance
→ Lighthouse

AI Failure Analysis
→ execution evidence
→ sanitization
→ structured analysis
→ human review

AI Test Suite Generation
→ feature context
→ structured test-design proposal
→ human review

AI-Assisted Engineering
→ repository context + authoritative discovery evidence
→ Copilot / Agent proposal
→ human review
→ deterministic validation
```

## Execution Evidence

The public showcase includes **reviewed evidence from real executions of the canonical framework**.

Published evidence currently covers:

- API and runtime contract validation;
- Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit UI execution;
- automated accessibility analysis;
- deterministic visual regression;
- k6 API performance;
- public Lighthouse CI execution;
- authenticated Playwright + Lighthouse execution;
- reports, screenshots, visual baselines, and failure diagnostics.

Validated AI capability currently covers:

- AI Failure Analysis using controlled real Playwright failure evidence and live OpenAI analysis;
- AI Test Suite Generation using structured feature context and live OpenAI generation;
- schema validation around structured AI output;
- evidence sanitization before AI analysis;
- Copilot-assisted test generation and human refinement;
- Copilot Agent engineering and deterministic validation;
- OpenAPI MCP-assisted provider-contract discovery;
- Playwright MCP-assisted browser exploration and UI test implementation.

### API & Contract

**28 / 28 tests passed**

The published API evidence demonstrates authentication, runtime contract validation, validation behavior, negative paths, and deterministic test data.

[Inspect API execution evidence →](docs/showcases/api/README.md)

### UI & Cross-Browser

**18 / 18 tests passed**

The same browser scenarios execute across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, with six passing tests per browser engine.

[Inspect UI execution evidence →](docs/showcases/ui/README.md)

### Accessibility

The accessibility quality gate detected **two real product accessibility issues** rather than converting the run into an artificial green result.

The selected evidence includes serious `color-contrast` violations with an observed contrast ratio of **3.81:1** against the required **4.5:1**.

[Inspect accessibility evidence →](docs/showcases/accessibility/README.md)

### Visual Regression

**2 / 2 visual tests passed** against approved Linux baselines.

The published evidence demonstrates deterministic application state, controlled rendering, full-page and component-level screenshot comparison, and explicit baseline ownership.

[Inspect visual regression evidence →](docs/showcases/visual-regression/README.md)

### Performance

Performance responsibility is separated into API workload and browser-observed measurement.

Published evidence includes:

```text
k6 API workload
→ 2 VUs / 30 seconds
→ 52 iterations
→ 56 / 56 checks
→ 0% failures
→ p95 257.33 ms

Public Lighthouse CI
→ 3 runs
→ canonical LHCI assertions
→ execution completed without assertion failure

Authenticated Lighthouse
→ Playwright-established authenticated state
→ 3 independent audits
→ median aggregation for portfolio reporting
```

Standalone Lighthouse CI assertions and portfolio median summaries are intentionally treated as different concepts. The median summaries do not represent Lighthouse CI's assertion algorithm.

[Inspect performance evidence →](docs/showcases/performance/README.md)

### Failure Diagnostics

A selected accessibility failure is preserved as a diagnostic case study.

The evidence demonstrates that a failed quality gate is not automatically a framework regression. Reports and artifacts are used to distinguish product defects from framework, environment, infrastructure, external-platform, and known-product-issue domains.

[Inspect diagnostic evidence →](docs/showcases/diagnostics/README.md)

### AI-Assisted Quality Engineering

AI capabilities are integrated into the framework as structured, reviewable engineering workflows rather than autonomous quality gates.

AI Failure Analysis follows:

```text
Playwright Failure
        ↓
Execution Evidence
        ↓
Evidence Sanitization
        ↓
OpenAI Analysis
        ↓
Structured Diagnostic Output
        ↓
Human Review
        ↓
Engineering Decision
```

The capability was locally validated end to end using a controlled real Playwright failure and live OpenAI analysis.

AI Test Suite Generation follows:

```text
System / Feature Context
        ↓
Risk & Behavior Inputs
        ↓
OpenAI
        ↓
Structured Test Suite Proposal
        ↓
Human Review
        ↓
Approved Coverage Model
        ↓
Implementation
```

The generated output is a structured test-design proposal rather than executable Playwright code. Missing provider behavior can be represented explicitly instead of being invented.

[Explore AI-Assisted Quality Engineering →](docs/capabilities/ai-assisted-qe/)

### AI-Assisted Engineering & MCP

AI-assisted implementation uses repository architecture and authoritative discovery evidence as separate inputs.

```text
Repository Architecture
        +
Golden Templates
        +
Authoritative External Evidence
        ↓
AI Engineering Context
        ↓
GitHub Copilot / Agent
        ↓
Implementation Proposal
        ↓
Human Review
        ↓
Targeted Feedback
        ↓
Refined Implementation
        ↓
Typecheck / Tests / CI
        ↓
Approved Change
```

OpenAPI MCP provides provider-contract evidence.

Playwright MCP provides runtime browser evidence.

Neither source replaces repository architecture, implementation ownership, or deterministic validation.

[Explore AI-Assisted Engineering & MCP →](docs/capabilities/ai-assisted-engineering/)

> AI Failure Analysis CI artifact-download validation remains a non-blocking evidence gap. The framework-owned AI capabilities are validated at their documented local boundaries, while AI-assisted engineering remains subject to human review and deterministic validation.

> Docker, GitHub Actions, and GHCR are implemented parts of the canonical engineering system. Their architecture is documented publicly; a dedicated sanitized public CI/CD / Docker / GHCR execution-evidence package is intentionally deferred.

## Selected Engineering Highlights

### Schema-First Runtime Contracts

Compile-time TypeScript types do not prove that an external provider actually returned the expected structure.

The API layer therefore validates successful provider responses at runtime before test code trusts the returned data.

```text
HTTP Response
      ↓
Status Assertion
      ↓
Parse Response
      ↓
AJV Runtime Validation
      ↓
Typed Business Assertions
```

TypeBox provides the schema/type relationship while AJV validates the actual runtime response.

---

### Deterministic Test Architecture

Test setup favors reusable fixtures, deterministic factories, and API-driven initialization when browser interaction is not the behavior under test.

```text
Scenario
   ↓
Fixture
   ↓
Factory
   ↓
API / Authentication Setup
   ↓
Deterministic Application State
   ↓
Behavior Under Test
```

The objective is to keep tests focused on the behavior they own while reusable infrastructure manages setup and lifecycle concerns.

---

### Explicit Execution Ownership

Execution scope follows the responsibility being tested.

Browser-independent API coverage is not multiplied across browser engines. UI behavior owns cross-browser execution. Accessibility and visual regression have dedicated execution boundaries.

Performance testing uses the runtime appropriate to the measurement responsibility:

```text
API workload performance
→ k6

Browser-observed performance
→ Lighthouse
```

This avoids unnecessary execution while keeping quality ownership explicit.

---

### Reproducible Visual Testing

Visual regression uses:

- deterministic application state;
- native Playwright screenshot assertions;
- version-controlled approved baselines;
- explicit baseline review;
- a canonical Docker/Linux rendering environment.

CI compares against approved baselines. It does not automatically approve rendering changes.

---

### Reuse Before New Abstraction

When deterministic setup already exists in the functional framework, additional quality coverage reuses that setup instead of creating parallel business-state initialization.

The authenticated Lighthouse path follows this principle:

```text
existing deterministic setup
        ↓
authenticated application state
        ↓
representative page state
        ↓
Lighthouse measurement
```

The measurement layer changes. The business-state initialization does not.

---

### AI Within Engineering Boundaries

AI output is treated as engineering input rather than deterministic truth.

Framework-owned AI capabilities use structured schemas, runtime validation, sanitization, explicit uncertainty handling, and human review.

AI-assisted implementation uses repository architecture, Golden Templates, and authoritative external evidence before deterministic validation.

```text
AI Proposal
      ↓
Human Review
      ↓
Targeted Refinement
      ↓
Formatting / Typecheck / Tests
      ↓
Approved Engineering Change
```

The engineering system remains authoritative.

---

### Build Once, Run Many

The main Playwright CI pipeline builds one reusable Docker image and publishes it to GHCR under the current commit SHA.

Downstream execution responsibilities reuse that exact image.

```text
quality
   ↓
build image once
   ↓
GHCR : commit SHA
   ↓
   ├── API
   ├── Accessibility
   ├── Visual Regression
   └── UI Browser Matrix
```

This separates the reusable execution environment from the Playwright project responsible for deciding what executes.

[Explore the engineering decisions →](docs/ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md)

---

## CI/CD at a Glance

The main CI dependency model is:

```text
quality
├── formatting
└── typecheck
        ↓
build-image
        ↓
push immutable commit-SHA image to GHCR
        ↓
        ├── API
        ├── Accessibility
        ├── Visual Regression
        └── UI Browser Matrix
              ├── Chromium
              ├── Firefox
              └── WebKit
```

The downstream Playwright responsibilities reuse the same container image rather than rebuilding separate environments for individual test projects.

Performance execution is owned separately:

```text
Performance Workflow
├── k6 API Performance
└── Browser Performance
    ├── Standalone Lighthouse
    └── Authenticated Playwright + Lighthouse
```

The current hosted performance workflow is intentionally separate from normal push and pull-request execution because the target application is shared infrastructure rather than an isolated load-test environment.

The CI/CD, Docker, and GHCR implementation is documented publicly. Dedicated sanitized public execution evidence for this infrastructure layer is intentionally deferred.

## Selected Source

This repository is intentionally **not a public mirror of the complete framework**.

The core API and UI automation architecture is published here as **selected public-safe source copied directly from the verified canonical implementation**, without showcase-specific rewrites.

The published source includes:

```text
config/
└── environments/

src/
├── accessibility/   # shared canonical dependencies used by the published fixture layer
├── api/
├── components/
├── data/
├── fixtures/
├── mocks/
├── pages/
└── utils/

tests/
├── api/
├── smoke/
└── ui/
```

This source demonstrates:

- domain API client design;
- TypeBox contracts and AJV runtime validation;
- Page Object and Component Object boundaries;
- fixture composition and programmatic authentication;
- deterministic test-data factories;
- network mocking;
- API, smoke, and cross-browser UI test design;
- environment-aware configuration.

Public representation intentionally differs by capability:

```text
API / UI / Cross-Browser
→ selected public-safe canonical source
→ architecture
→ real sanitized execution evidence

Accessibility / Visual Regression / Performance
→ architecture
→ real sanitized execution evidence

AI-Assisted Quality Engineering
→ curated architecture
→ structured validation boundaries
→ reviewed validation evidence

AI-Assisted Engineering & MCP
→ curated workflow representation
→ evidence-source boundaries
→ human review and deterministic validation

Docker / GitHub Actions / GHCR
→ implemented canonical architecture
→ public architecture documentation
→ dedicated sanitized execution-evidence publication deferred
```

Source publication remains deliberately selective.

The goal is to make the **core API and UI architecture fully inspectable** while demonstrating broader Quality Engineering capability without publishing the complete canonical framework or creating a parallel framework that must be maintained independently.

## Runnable Public Framework

Alongside this curated showcase, a standalone public Playwright + TypeScript framework is available for direct inspection, cloning, and local execution.

It demonstrates the core API, UI, contract-validation, cross-browser, Docker, and CI engineering patterns represented throughout this portfolio.

**[Explore the runnable Playwright Enterprise Framework →](https://github.com/szabihudak/playwright-enterprise-framework)**

The runnable repository is intentionally separate from the complete canonical framework and from this curated evidence layer.

## About This Showcase

This repository is a **curated public Quality Engineering case study**.

The complete implementation is maintained separately as the canonical engineering source of truth.

The public showcase combines:

```text
Selected Implementation
        +
Architecture
        +
Engineering Decisions
        +
Real Execution Evidence
        +
AI-Assisted Engineering
        +
Portfolio Presentation
        +
Engineering Roadmap
```

Every implemented capability presented here must be backed by verified implementation.

Every execution result presented here must come from real framework execution and pass a public-safety review.

AI-generated analysis, test design, and implementation proposals remain subject to structured validation, deterministic execution where applicable, and human engineering review.

Future capabilities remain explicitly identified as roadmap work until they are implemented and validated.

The objective is not to expose the largest possible amount of source code.

It is to make the **engineering system, implementation quality, design decisions, evidence, and evolution of the Quality Engineering approach** easy to evaluate.
